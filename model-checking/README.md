## Environment setup

This part of the workshop uses [TLA+ extensions](https://github.com/alygin/vscode-tlaplus/wiki/How-to-Install) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run [TLC model checker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B). Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/alygin/vscode-tlaplus/wiki/How-to-Install) for TLA+ extensions to setup development environment.
